Hi there, I'm Juan Eduardo Bedoya, I'm from Colombia and I'm currently an undergraduated student on software engineering in the National University of Colombia.

I'm interested on:

- Neural Networks
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- And AI in general.
 
 I'm passionate about tackling challenging projects and continuously expanding my knowledge to create valuable, impactful applications, and thus I'm open to participate in new and challenging projects around these fields.

 I'm also into frontend developing with Flutter, interfaces design based on UI and UX, specially for mobile apps.
